As you listen, walk with me along the other side of the street so you can get a good look at this big concrete structure and the colors and words and bodies painted on its side.

His second book, Heart Notes was published in 2019. In 2020 and 2021 he was named Best Poet/Spoken Word Performer in Cedar Rapids & Iowa City.

						Wave Cage</span>
					</div>	
				</div>
				<div>
					<span class='artist_name'>Wave Cage</span> is a jazz fusion/electronic band featuring Jarrett Purdy on keys and synths, Ryan Garmoe on trumpet, Nolan Schroeder on sax, and Chris Jensen on drums. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Their debut project, The Portrait EP, was described by Little Village Magazine as "an engaging, atmospheric, beautifully produced, and humorous recording", and by the River Cities' Reader as "evoking the smooth melodies and diverse textures of early Weather Report; the ambitious, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink arrangements of groups such as Jaga Jazzist; and the more genre-agnostic trip-hop beat decisions of such projects as Thievery Corporation and Zero 7." 
					<br>
					<br>
					Wave Cage's second project is set for release in June 2022 with financial support provided by a grant from the Iowa Arts Council, a division of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
